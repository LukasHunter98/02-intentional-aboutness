# Visual selfie 

# Introduction 

Here is an example of my case study. The work is a personal flag that I created during my second semester at my graphic design school. The task was to create a unique selfie that would describe our personality, so I created my own personal flag that’s hanging on a flag pole in the skies.

# The Process

The process of creating this work was not as easy as it may seem as flag design ideas can be visualised in many different ways and I had to settle on one design only. My original idea was to use specific country symbols, but my professor advised me to use a design more of my own so I had to come up with my own symbols and colours. The professor showed some flag ideas on Pinterest, that were completely abstract in terms of form and colour and I wasn’t sure what those colours and symbols represented but I liked them and decided to make something similar in terms of design, but I had to focus on giving it its own meaning, because you can’t just create your own personal flag without any symbolism and meaning.
